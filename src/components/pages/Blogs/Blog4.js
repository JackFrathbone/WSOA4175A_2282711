          With the first real version of my website now working, it seems
          appropriate to look back at the progress made, especially in light of
          what I want to achieve with this work overall. While it feels like
          progress has been a bit slow generally, my website has at least
          visually achieved the look I wanted. The inspiration for my site has
          been to replicate the look of an FGM-148 Javelin anti-tank weapon
          systems interface to directly tie into the themes I want to explore.
        </p>

          I still need to flesh out some details, like adding animation and
          sound effects to the buttons, as well as adding buttons on the side
          that allow the user to toggle between the top and bottom buttons. This
          is to better replicate the functionality found in a javelin interface,
          and add some interesting navigation to the site to better engage the
          viewer.I also need to focus on other visual polish, but mostly small
          things such as a more dynamic blog viewer that uses react.js more
          efficiently to display blog posts. Some other visual tweaks like
          making the scrollbar better fit the sights overall aesthetic would
          also help. Otherwise happy with the practical progress made.
        </p>

          Theoretically I feel that I am moving in the right direction, but have
          not had a chance to really engage with the exact topics I want to work
          on with the blogs. Since the start of the project I have wanted to
          look at the role of U.S. imperialism and how it relates to the
          internet, particularly the depiction of violence and the American
          military online. So far my focus has been on the visual side, making a
          connection between the symbol of American military power that is the
          javelin weapon system and my website's aesthetic. I have been very
          inspired to pursue this whole angle by the book Cyborg Worlds: the
          military information society which is a marxist exploration of the
          future merging of corporate technology with the military industrial
          complex of the United States (Levidow & Robins, 1989).
        </p>
        <p>
          I feel there is an important connection between private American
          ownership of internet platforms, and the positive portrayal of
          American militarism and imperialism found on popular social media
          websites. People in the global south are subjected to these views with
          less room to challenge this discourse because of the sheer scale of
          anglo-American views online. I hope to further engage with this topic
          theoretically, with my last blogpost touching a bit on this topic. I
          hope to use the next stages of my website to really dig into this
          question and make a piece of netart that helps to showcase this
          problem. With a bulk of the practical website building busywork out of
          the way I hopefully can spend more time fully engaging with the
          theory.
