          The internet as a tool for global communication brings with it various
          possibilities, both good and bad, for letting people across the world
          be heard. On one hand there are obvious benefits to borderless(at
          least mostly) communication, with people being able to speak more
          directly without the restrictions that governments across the world
          place on traditional media and communications. But what the modern
          internet experience has shown is that both its privatized nature, and
          the often undiscussed role of cultural imperialism, places huge limits
          on how people engage with the internet, in favor of voices that are
          already privileged globally.

          Madianou writes about the concept of ‘technocolonialism’ which is an
          idea exploring technologically based inequality that exists between
          the global north and south (Madianou, 2019). Madianou argues that
          current ‘digital humanitarian’ trends that seek to solve the issues of
          the global south through technology “reinvigorate and rework colonial
          relationships of dependency.” (Madianou, 2019: 10). That is, in a
          world dominated by U.S. imperialism, with the majority of big internet
          platforms based in the United States, there is a strong tendency for
          North American views to dominate global online discourse. This can
          only come at the expense of other voices across the world, which are
          required to stay either in small regional bubbles or cater to a
          westernized audience in order to fully participate in global
          discourse. This is not just limited to social media, but the sheer
          quantity of english language and US based websites force people across
          the internet to engage or be locked out.

          In the book Design Justice Costanza-Chock argues that alternative
          approaches to both web design, and internet mediation are required to
          refocus design on building and helping communities to be properly
          represented (Costanza-Chock, 2020). That is an active process of
          rebuilding and redesigning digital spaces to better represent the
          people who use them, and move away from harmful practices that silence
          or privilege certain voices over others. Overall an active process is
          required to stop and turn back the existing form of the internet that
          has allowed people in the global north to dominate the internet
          landscape.

          These questions about access, privilege and fair representation on the
          internet will only become increasingly more important as more of the
          world is connected. More countries are seeing internet access as an
          important right for their citizens, with initiatives to create greater
          access (Daniolou, 2020). But greater access to the internet will also
          exacerbate its current issues, and worldwide new alternatives need to
          be built if a truly global and representative internet is to be
          created.
