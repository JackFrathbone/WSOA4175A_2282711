        <h1>Blog 9: Design Reflection</h1>
        <p>
          When I first started building this site I had not figured out exactly
          what I wanted to focus on, just some vague broad themes such as
          militarism and digital violence, which led me to the first major
          design choice I made. This was to style the entire website on the
          interface of a weapon system, which also had multiple layers, with a
          javelin missile launcher something that players of games like Call of
          Duty would be familiar with as well, so their own recognition of the
          interface would demonstrate the extent of how we have normalised tools
          of violence. But it was through the research done on internet art for
          the blogs that I started getting more ideas for where I could take the
          website.

        <p>
          From the research done I started to get an idea about how I could
          focus the site, and alongside an artwork tell a specific message. For
          the actual message I was deeply inspired by reading a book titled
          Cyborg Worlds: the military information society which was a
          fascinating academic work from the late 80’s which very much predicted
          the relationship between the military industrial complex and the
          development of the internet, especially how so much of our technology
          is shaped and driven by military needs. I combined this with my own
          personal understanding of global and modern imperialism as defined by
          Vladimir Lenin in Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism. Thus
          came the overall idea that I would focus on how specially United
          States imperialism has determined the way we learn and discuss
          knowledge on the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          The overall idea became a focus on how US cultural and digital
          hegemony has an effect on pushing all online discourse towards
          official US viewpoints, which in turn enable and support global
          American military violence. This worked with the military theme of the
          site and opened up many more possibilities for my artwork. I
          originally knew I wanted to do a textual artwork of some sort, and I
          started to think of the idea of the ‘corrupting’ influence of US
          imperialism on knowledge. From this the idea of mixing the text of
          Lenin’s Imperialism with something contradictory came about, randomly
          showing people who visited the site censored passages from the book,
          and clicking the censorship would reveal the text replaced with
          excerpts from American foreign policy documents.
        </p>
        <p>
          I feel looking back at my process and its outcome that the design of
          the site and my overall concept was good, it followed a logical
          process and developed as I explored more with the possibility of
          internet art. I think I was lucky my ideas stayed along the same line
          as it was difficult to come up with a whole concept at the beginning
          without knowing the subject of internet art. I do feel like my site
          could have had more detail put into it, for example I have a video
          section which just has a repeating gif of a tank being exploded, I
          originally wanted to put my own custom video showing scenes from
          Johannesburg interspersed with military vehicles being destroyed. But
          both time and the changing of the concept made me leave this idea
          behind, but I think I could have done better and replaced this section
          with something more appropriate. The experience could have been
          tighter but this was just a difficulty of working with something that
          was changing over time in its intent.
