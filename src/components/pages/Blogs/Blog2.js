        <p>
          There is an assumption when discussing visual design for websites that
          older, usually seen as worse, websites were not designed with the same
          principles that modern, better, websites now use. But the fundamentals
          of web design carry over from print media, computer programs and even
          architecture, concepts like accessibility, universally understandable
          symbols etc have existed before modern web design guides told us these
          things were necessary. An old HTML website from 1999 would still try
          to be easy to use, navigate and find stuff, but was limited by the
          tools available at the time, and concepts that were yet to be
          developed. There has been a fundamental change in aesthetics that has
          really pushed the difference between older and newer web design.

          Lisbeth Thorlacius argues that “Visual symbols have become an integral
          part of our daily lives” in the modern era and that the shift in web
          design comes from the incorporation of semiotic design into
          traditional website building (Thorlacius, 2007: 66). What would once
          have been plain text and hyperlinks can be broken down into buttons
          with clear symbols, drop down menus and dynamically changing content,
          turning the textual overload of the ‘front page’ into a more visual
          experience. Alongside the growing ease of hosting images on the web,
          visual design language replaced the older textual design of early
          2000’s websites. The function of the site is not vastly different, but
          clarity and focus are increased and there are even more opportunities
          for sites to break down information into more easily accessible pieces
          than before.

          In the previous year, one of my projects was to make a website that
          felt like it had been abandoned in the 2000’s and been corrupted over
          time. While doing readings on user experience and design I found that
          they still applied to how I was building the site, just because it was
          aesthetically defunct did not mean its function was stunted. But
          working without the symbols that are common today, or drop down menus,
          did make it much more difficult to cleanly direct user navigation. But
          overall it felt like aesthetics was separate from design, though it
          does contribute to the general feeling of a website being ‘well
          designed’ even if functionally it is identical to a more modern and
          sleek site. Good design may be seen as design that taps into common
          understanding to make more accessible websites, and if symbols have
          become a core part of modern language then not using them does make
          websites more difficult to understand and navigate.
